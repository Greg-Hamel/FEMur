# FEMur

A simple Finite Element Modeling (FEM) library. It was originally developed for a Master's level course, but it's development is being expanded to become a more well-rounded library which could be use to solve real-world problems.

# Goals

1.  Solve exercises and homework for a Master's Level Finite Element Method Application course (short term).
2.  Expand into a fully developed and easy-to-use FEM software (long term).
